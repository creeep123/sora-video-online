## How to Use

The Palworld Breeding Calculator is a powerful tool designed to help players find the best breeding combinations for their Pals. Here’s how you can make the most of it:

1. **Selecting Parent Pals**: Start by choosing two of your Pals you wish to breed. The calculator allows you to input characteristics of each parent, including their species and traits.

2. **Predicting Offspring**: Upon entering the parent Pals, the calculator will display the possible offspring. This includes the likelihood of each possible species and their potential traits.

3. **Reverse Calculation**: If you have a specific offspring in mind, the calculator can also work in reverse. Select the desired offspring, and it will show you all possible parent combinations that can result in that specific Pal.

Remember, while the calculator provides a solid prediction, actual results can vary due to the game's inherent randomness.
